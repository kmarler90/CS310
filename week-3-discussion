Incorrect Comparison Operator:

if (dayOfWeek = "Sunday")
The single equal sign (=) is the assignment operator, not the comparison operator. This line assigns the string "Sunday" to the dayOfWeek variable, and then evaluates the result of the assignment, which will always be true.
To compare strings for equality, you should use the double equal sign (==). The correct line should be: if (dayOfWeek == "Sunday").
Incorrect Return Value:

return O;
The return value in the main function should be 0 (zero) to indicate successful program execution. The letter "O" is not a valid return value in this context.

"fixed code"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string dayOfWeek;

    // Input
    cout << "Enter the day of the week (i.e Monday, Tuesday, etc.): ";
    getline(cin, dayOfWeek); //get line is better for string input.

    // Selection control
    if (dayOfWeek == "Sunday") {
        cout << "Weekly assignments are due today, better get to it!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "You still have time to complete your weekly assignments!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
