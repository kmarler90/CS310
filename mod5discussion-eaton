// Hey love the code its always good to have a bit of fun with this!  so to get started the first thing is "int how_much_suck[int num]" first thing that really caught me was the squared brackets it certainly took my brain a second to figure out that it was supposed to be 
// parenthesis so that was a good one to think about!  next up for me was the curly braces or brackets "{}" that thing.  that is needed for the function body and was missing and also after "return num + (100 - num)" there is no semi-colon ";" below is the fixed code that does work.  also love the humor!







#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to calculate how much this sucks (it always sucks 100%)
int how_much_suck(int num) {
    return num + (100 - num);
}

int main() {
    int sucks;

    // Input
    cout << "How much does this suck? Enter a number from 1 to 100: ";
    cin >> sucks;
    cout << endl;

    // Output
    cout << "Yeah! This sucks " << how_much_suck(sucks) << "%." << endl;

    return 0;
}
